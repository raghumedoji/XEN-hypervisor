Architecture:

Xen Hypervisor is a Type 1 hypervisor, also known as a "bare-metal" hypervisor. It runs directly on the hardware, below the host operating system.
Domain 0 (Dom0): This is a privileged virtual machine (VM) that has direct access to hardware and can manage other VMs. It is used for administrative tasks.
Domains (DomUs): These are the unprivileged VMs running on top of Dom0. They have limited access and rely on Dom0 for hardware interactions.
Functions:

Resource Management: Xen manages CPU, memory, and I/O resources for each VM. It ensures isolation and fair allocation of resources.
Virtualization: Xen provides virtual environments for multiple operating systems to run on the same hardware.
Inter-VM Communication: Xen supports communication between VMs through shared memory and virtual network interfaces.
Security and Isolation: Xen isolates VMs from each other, enhancing security and stability.
